Employee Onboarding Guide – Processes, Workflows & System Procedures

This guide defines the standardized onboarding workflow used across all departments. It ensures efficient assimilation of new employees while meeting documentation, security, and tax requirements.

1. Pre-Boarding Overview

Before a new hire’s first day, the following actions must be completed:
- Offer letter signed via DocuSign
- Background check cleared (criminal, employment verification, education verification)
- Equipment requests submitted to IT
- System accounts provisioned through the HR+ Identity Management service

Account provisioning includes:
- HR+ system access
- Email & calendar setup

2. Onboarding Workflow in HR+

The HR+ onboarding system automates new hire workflows using task-based templates. Standard onboarding includes:
- Personal details collection
- Tax withholding forms (W-4, state-specific forms)
- Direct deposit setup
- Employee handbook acknowledgment
- Code of Conduct training
- Mandatory compliance courses (security, harassment prevention)
Tasks are assigned deadlines and completion statuses tracked in real time.

3. Document Management

Documents are stored securely in the encrypted HR+ Document Vault. Supported formats include PDF, JPG, PNG, and DOCX. HR admins can tag documents using the metadata system (document type, expiration date, legal category).
