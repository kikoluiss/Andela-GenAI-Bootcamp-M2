Time Tracking & Attendance Guide – System Usage, Automation & Compliance

This guide explains the HR+ Time Tracking module, which supports automated attendance, labor compliance, and detailed work-hour reporting.

1. Clocking Methods

Employees can clock in using:
- Web portal
- Mobile app (with GPS & geofencing)
- Biometric timeclock

Time entries sync automatically within 30 seconds.

2. Break & Meal Compliance

HR+ includes built-in compliance rules for:
- Mandatory meal breaks
- Short rest breaks
- Penalty pay for missed meals
- Split-shift rules
- Double compliance regions (e.g., CA, NY)
Violations appear on timecard audits.

3. Timesheet Approvals

Managers must approve timesheets by the end of each pay period. Approval actions include:
- Approve
- Reject with comments
- Request correction
All actions have immutable audit logs (timestamp, IP, user ID).

4. Scheduling Module

Schedules include:
- Fixed shifts
- Rotating shifts
- Split shifts
- On-call schedules
- Demand-driven forecasting (for retail/hospitality)
HR+ provides labor forecasting using historical utilization and seasonal trends.

5. Manual Adjustments

Manual adjustments require:
- Manager approval
- Employee acknowledgment
- Reason code selection (missed punch, malfunction, correction)
Changes are stored indefinitely for audit compliance.
